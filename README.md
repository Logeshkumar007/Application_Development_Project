# Eco Ride

Eco Ride is a web-based car-sharing platform built for the students of SKCET. It provides an eco-friendly and convenient way for students to share rides, allowing drivers to offer available seats in their vehicles, and passengers to find rides along the same route. This platform promotes carpooling, reducing travel costs and contributing to a more sustainable environment.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Material UI, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Spring Boot

3. **Search for Rides**: Passengers can search for available rides based on their desired departure location.
4. **Ride History**: Both drivers and passengers can view their ride history (upcoming, ongoing, and completed).
5. **Deep Learning-Based ID Verification**: The system uses deep learning to recognize and validate student IDs during sign-up.
6. **Filter Options**: Users can filter ride searches to find the best matches for their needs.

## Future Plans
